      <h2 style="color:darkblue;">Programing Is Everywhere</h2>

      <p id="tribute-info" style="color:darkgreen;">Programming is, quite literally, all around us. From the take-out we order, to the movies we stream, code enables everyday actions in our lives. Tech companies are no longer recognizable as just software companies — instead, they bring food to our door, help us get a taxi, influence outcomes in presidential elections, or act as a personal trainer.</p>

      <h3 style="color:darkblue;">WHAT IS PROGRAMMING?</h3>
      <p id="tribute-link" style="color:darkgreen;" >Put simply, programming is giving a set of instructions to a computer to execute. If you’ve ever cooked using a recipe before, you can think of yourself as the computer and the recipe’s author as a programmer. The recipe author provides you with a set of instructions which you read and then follow. The more complex the instructions, the more complex the result!</p>
